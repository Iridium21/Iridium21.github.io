									<p>I’m particularly interested in flying, and everything that Aeromodelling relates itself to. I believe I’m just on the surface of technology, knowledge and understanding should go together. There’s much more to learn; and it is important to understand why it is that way. I’m the kind of person who learns a lot through interaction: asking questions and most importantly- focussing on the practical aspect. I’ve always wanted to build things, I’m an artist myself, and even though I appreciate the aesthetics of the planes and drones we fly, I’m more interested in anticipating what’s within them. </p>

											<p>I am currently working on building a clone of DJI Mavic Pro. All the parts have been 3D printed and assembled.
											All that's left is giving life to it with the electronics. This is one of the projects that gives sanity to the last four years of my craziness for quadcopters.  </p>

												<h3>Iris!</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Iris- as we call it at Aeromodelling Club was officially revealed in the tech orientation and the response of the freshies was beyond what I expected.
This post will take you through the timeline of building it and my experience of building my first Quadcopter ever.

The build, although not tough, was a meditation in itself. I had barely two and a half days to build it and get it flying. We wanted the freshers to see it flying in the orientation. The three months of vacation propelled me towards getting here- and so, I did a lot of research. On the specifications of the parts I would be ordering. Everything is interrelated, and so you have to mentally make sure everything works out exactly how you planned. 
  </p>



<p> Apart from improvisations, one thing I focussed on was achieving a clean build. Space Management was a challenge and fun too. 

The most time consuming part was cutting wires and soldering them in places to achieve that clean build. Heat shrinks are extremely efficient and satisfying to use. And yes zipties, how could I handle things without them!
Those two days were almost spent in TL, I had to go back to my hostel to eat, and that was irritating, given that I live in H6. the cycle rides were terrible, with the rain showers. 

Me and Jigyasu tested out the Quad in TL, which was quite a risky thing to do. But of course, we had Jigyasu. (Kids, do not try to attempt what Jigyasu does, he has a power to talk with Quadcopters and they seem to obey his commands) The way he controlled Iris, it showed how comfortable he was with Quadcopters. I share similar interests. And I am getting more comfortable with Iris as time passes. The responses are high, it is very sensitive, and that adds to the challenge in flying it. 

At the end of those two days, Iris was ready, and we were hoping for the best during the Orientation!

</P> <p>When I gave my interview for the post of convener, I was asked what projects I would take as a convener, and the first project was this. Not surprising at all, for Savneek and Yash and all the members of the club for that matter know how crazy I am for Quadcopters.
It was a dream since I first came across Quadcopters in 9th Grade to build one, and so today as I type this, I feel overwhelmed that I have finally begun my journey- into Quadcopters, Airplanes, Gliders, Rockets, FPV Racing Drones and what not!

This is the beginning, and there is more to come, I promise that.</p>

<p>

I would like to express my gratitude to Savneek Bhatia- Our Manager. He always encourages us to build whatever we want to. Savneek, maybe you don’t realise this but it means a lot to have that support from you at every step. Be it the project or anything trivial. We have a great team within our club. Pranav, Akhilesh, Vedanth, Ronit and Jigyasu helped me with the soldering and other small yet significant things throughout those two days. Thank you guys! 

Finally it feels great to be a part of this club, this community that has been “Fighting against the Wind, since 2003!”
